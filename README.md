## Project Overview
This project was conducted for **Mitron Bank**, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, which plans to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its product offerings. **AtliQ Data Services** proposed a data-driven solution for this initiative. As part of a pilot project, Mitron Bank provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities, focusing on their online spending and demographic details. The insights generated from this data will guide the creation of tailored credit card products.

## Problem Statement and Background
Mitron Bank is exploring ways to introduce a new line of credit cards. Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services, was tasked with analyzing the customer data provided by the bank and delivering key insights to the strategy team. Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey, diving deep into customer demographics, spending patterns, and credit scores to uncover trends and preferences that could shape the productâ€™s success. His analysis is crucial for securing the project by providing actionable, data-driven recommendations that demonstrate a deep understanding of the target customersâ€™ needs.

## Key Objectives
The key objectives of this project were:
1. Analyze the spending patterns and demographic information of Mitron Bank's customers sample data and generate insights to be presented to the strategy team of Mitron Bank.
2. Provide actionable insights to help Mitron Bank tailor credit card offerings to specific customer segments.
3. Identify key customer groups that are most likely to be high-value users of the new credit cards.
4. Present the findings in a clear, visual, and impactful Tableau dashboard.

## Data Description
The project uses two primary data sources provided by Mitron Bank:

- **`dim_customers.csv`**: Contains demographic information about customers, such as:
  - `customer_id`: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
  - `gender`: Gender of the customer (Male, Female).
  - `age_group`: Age groups of customers (e.g., 21-24, 25-34).
  - `marital_status`: Marital status (Single, Married).
  - `city`: Customer's city of residence (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi-NCR).
  - `occupation`: Profession (e.g., Salaried IT Employees, Business Owners).
  - `average_income`: Monthly average income of the customer (in INR).

- **`fact_spends.csv`**: Contains information about customers' online spending across various categories, including:
  - `customer_id`: Unique ID linked to the `dim_customers` table.
  - `month`: Month in which the spending was recorded.
  - `category`: Spending category (e.g., Entertainment, Electronics).
  - `payment_type`: Type of payment method used (e.g., Debit Card, Credit Card).
  - `spends`: Total amount spent in the specified category and month.

## Dashboard Description
The Tableau dashboard provides multiple views that help decision-makers at Mitron Bank understand customer behavior and preferences. The dashboard includes the following pages:

1. **Landing Page**: A view that directs users to specific analysis sections.
2. **Demographics**: A breakdown of customers by gender, age, occupation, and city, helping to understand customer diversity.
3. **Spend Analysis - 1**: A detailed analysis of average customer spending across various factors such as age, category, and occupation
